# Langton's Ant Console Application

This project is legacy code from when I first tried messing around with C++ to create command line applications. 
This particular piece of code is a console application of Langton's ant, a cellular automata where an ant moves around a grid according to the colour (or number, in this case) displayed on the tile.
As the ant leaves the tile, they change the tile's colour to a different one, creating emergent behaviour.

The number of rows/columns/colours/steps the ant takes are all variables within the code and can be tweaked to generate different grid patterns. 
As this programme is quite simplistic and could be improved, I plan to make a second Langton's ant application using SFML to render the colours and provide a user interface so that different multiple colour extensions may be selected at runtime. 
Look out for that on my Github page in the near future.
